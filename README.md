##  Project Overview
This repository contains our group’s solution for **Assignment 1 – Data Science Challenge**.  
The goal was to develop and compare machine-learning models that predict whether a person received the **H1N1 vaccine**, using the features provided in *Dataset B*.  

The challenge evaluated:
- data exploration and preprocessing quality,  
- choice and justification of models,  
- critical analysis of performance (F1 score),  
- explainability,  
- and collaborative workflow via GitHub + Colab.
